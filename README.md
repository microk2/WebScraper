A JS project made by a lazy pleb to get info from websites.\
Maybe it works better in other programming languages, who knows /shrug
## Requirements
1. Node.js - [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. A CLI (Git Bash, Cmd etc)

## How to use it
First of all you have to open the project folder with a CLI and write:
```npm init``` to download all dependencies

* Get quest starter/ender for WoW quests:\
With any CLI go to the project folder and write:
```
node queststarter "your_quest_ids_separated_by_comma"
```
Example: ```node queststarter "1234, 5464, 8135, 43312"```\
This will create a .sql file with the SQL queries for creature/gameobject queststarter/ender for your quests.\
